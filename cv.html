        <h2>Senior Full-Stack Software Developer</h2>
        <p>
          During my career I worked with various technologies on different platforms from kernel drivers for Windows to single-page applications in TypeScript.
          I love working in a team and I believe that communication is one of the most important parts of software development (after cache invalidation and naming things, of course).

              I started from the very beginning, before the official
              release and was involved in development of almost every
              major feature on the platform (either in form of design
              discussions, code reviews or writing code).
            </p>

            <p>
              Provided support in hiring tech candidates by
              interviewing from a cultural and technical point of
              view. Helped to grow the tech team from 3 developers to 3
              teams of 5 people in each. Was helping junior developers
              in their professional growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              Being among the first
              developers in a young startup requires you to work in
              different areas. I was designing and shaping the platform
              from a technical perspective, defining best engineering
              practices and improving them continuously, setting up
              infrastructure, continuous integration and deployment
              processes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Of course none of it was done on my own - I worked with
              great people and all of it is the result of our team effort.

              I was working on several Rails-based websites of various

              so besides building up my web development skills I
              learned a lot about agile practices and managing teams.
              I participated in the development of company’s style
              guides and project templates, was speaking on our weekly
              meetups about new technologies which could help the team
