				<h2>Senior Full-Stack Software Developer</h2>
        <p>
          During my career I worked with various technologies on different platforms from kernel drivers for Windows to SPAs in TypeScript.
          I love working in a team and I believe that communication is one of the most important parts of software development (after naming and cache invalidation, of course).
