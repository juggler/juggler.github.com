Today I'm releasing [clojureweb-chef][clojureweb] as I promised in [previous post][previous]. `clojureweb-chef` is a collection of Chef recipes for setting up a server for Clojure deployment. Checkout `README` on github.

Also there is a [demo application][demo] for testing purposes.

Ping me on twitter if you have any questions or suggestions :)
