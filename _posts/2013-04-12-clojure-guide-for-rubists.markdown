Today at [Flatstack][fs] we were talking about Clojure and one of my collegues asked me to post a collection of links to Clojure resources. So this is not a guide, just a couple of links to start with:

First of all, offical resources. That's where all should start their journey:

  - Web site - [clojure.org][official]
  - Docs - [clojure.org/documentation][ofdocs]

Then there are community driven docs and conference talks:

- API Docs - [clojuredocs.org][docs]
- Community driven docs, tutorials, guides and articles - [clojure-doc.org][socialdoc]. You can read about them in my [previous post][prev].
- Youtube videos [@clojuretv][clojuretv]. I highly recommend Rich Hickey talks. Especially: [Hammock-Driven Development][hammock] and [Simple Made Easy][simple].

And here you can dive into Clojure code:

- [ClojureWerkz][cw]. It is "a growing collection of open source Clojure libraries". Some of them insired by Ruby's ActionModel, ActionMailer and others.
- [Leiningen][lein]. This a build tool for Clojure projects. You can think of it as a Clojure's rake, but it's more than that.
- Test framework - [midje][midje]
- [Ring][ring]. It's like Rack in a Clojure world.
- [Compojure][compojure]. And this one is Ruby's Sinatra.
- [The Clojure Toolbox][toolbox]. This one is like [ruby toolbox][rbtoolbox] but much smaller. Somebody [help them][clojure-toolbox-github] already! There should be at least two useful features: search and one-line description for each library.

Books:

- [Clojure Programming][cp] - learn language
- [The Joy of Clojure][joy] - learn philosphy

Other lists:

- [Tero Parviainen][teropa] shared his [gist][gist] with great collection of clojure tutorials and videos. You should definitely check it out.

P.S. After posting this I've received email messages with other suggestions, so I'll be updating this list to include more links to Clojure resources. Keep in touch!
